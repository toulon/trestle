  "readme": "Trestle is a scaffolding tool for node.js that originated from [trestle](https://github.com/saintedlama/trestle). In 6 commands you can have complete CRUD application, your mileage may vary of course, but see my wiki for details https://github.com/toulon/trestle/wiki\n\nGenerated projects rely on [express](http://expressjs.com/) and [mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) without any persistence abstractions,\nadditional libraries or frameworks. Just plain express and mongoose!\n\n# Roadmap\n**Done**\n- ~~Rename to Trestle~~\n- ~~Switch to Bootstrap 3.0~~\n- ~~Added ability to sort columns using tablesorter~~\n\n**Doing**\n- Fix the following configurations that do not seem to work\n    trestle: main: (app.js)\n    trestle: scripts/start: (nodemon -w models -w config -w routes app.js)\n    trestle: repository:\n- Make all config mongohq ready\n\n**Future**\n- Add pagination\n- Work on new logo\n\n# Installing Trestle\n\n\tnpm install trestle -g\n\n# Mini Tutorial\n\nFirst cd to the directory where the project should be created\n\n\tcd /path/to/projects/root\n\nCreate a project skeleton via\n\n\ttrestle app testapp\n\nNext cd to testapp\n\n\tcd testapp\n\nAnd install required packages through npm\n\n\tnpm install\n\n## Scaffolding - adding collections\nCreate a model, route and views via `scaffold` command. The model\nshould have two properties \"title\" and \"description\" where title is required.\n\n\ttrestle scaffold <collection> title:string:required:true description\n\nMinimum configuration to create a collection (all fields will be type string)\n\ttrestle scaffold <collection> <field1>:required <field2> <field3> <field4>\n\nNote: The first field must have property required as it will be the column that will be clicked\n\t\t\ton to edit the record.\n\nModel validators are specified after property name and type in plain mongoose syntax. In case\nno type is specified the property will be of type string.\n\nMongoose types 'String', 'Number', 'Date', 'Buffer', 'Boolean', 'ObjectId', 'Array' are supported. Additionally\nthe types 'Datetime' and 'Textarea' are supported which result in a datetime html 5 input tag and a textbox tag.\nTypes are case insensitive. If (for example) password is recognized as a password and the test will appear as \"*\"s\n\nNow start `node app.js` and navigate your browser to `http://localhost:3000/tests`\n\n### Scaffolding restful routes\n\nYou can create a JSON REST endpoint by scaffolding a model and its corresponding routes. The arguments are the same as above, but instead of _scaffold_ use _scafffold:rest_ like this\n\n\ttrestle resource post title:string:required:true description\n\n\n# Usage\n\n```\nProject generator for node.js using express and mongoose\n\nUsage:\n  trestle [options] command [arguments]\n\nOptions:\n  --help, -h                 Output this usage dialog\n  --version, -v              Output the version of trestle\n\nCommands:\n  app <collection>                 Create a new application\n  scaffold <collection> [attrib]   Create a new route, model and views for <collection>\n  resource <collection> [attrib]   Creates a model and route for resource <collection>\n  view <collection> [attrib]       Creates views for a <collection>\n  route <collection> [attrib]      Creates a route for a <collection>\n  model <collection> [attrib]      Creates a new mongoose model for a <collection>\n\ncollection:\n  Name should be provided as singular, so use `item` instead of `items`. For\n  `scaffold`, `view`, `route`, `resource`, `model` commands collection\n  accepts a path prefix. For example `admin/item` will create model, routes and\n  views in an admin directory. Routes will then point to `/admin/items`. This\n  option can be useful if you plan to add some authentication based on routes\n  later on.\n\nattrib:\n  Attributes are used to describe properties of models used in routes, views\n  and of course models using the schema:\n\n  field:type:validator:validatorValue:validator:validatorValue...\n\nExamples:\n  trestle app todo              Generates an express app skeleton\n  trestle scaffold item         Generates item model, route and views supporting\n                             basic CRUD operations\n  trestle view item             Generates item views\n\n  trestle scaffold collection field:string:required:true\n\n                             Generates item model, route and views with a single\n                             property \"collection\" that is required.\n```\n\n# What trestle creates\n\nAfter executing `trestle app <project>` you'll find the following structure in your file system.\n\n    |   app.js\n    |   helpers.js\n    |   package.json\n    |   README.md\n    |\n    +---config\n    |       defaults.js\n    |       development.js\n    |       index.js\n    |       production.js\n    |\n    +---lib\n    |       model-mapper.js\n    |\n    +---public\n    |   +---css\n    |   |       custom.css\n    |   |\n    |   \\---vendor\n    |       +---bootstrap\n    |       |   +---css\n    |       |   |       bootstrap-responsive.css\n    |       |   |       bootstrap-responsive.min.css\n    |       |   |       bootstrap.css\n    |       |   |       bootstrap.min.css\n    |       |   |\n    |       |   +---fonts\n    |       |   |       glyphicons-halflings-regular.eot\n    |       |   |       glyphicons-halflings-regular.svg\n    |       |   |       glyphicons-halflings-regular.ttf\n    |       |   |       glyphicons-halflings-regular.woff\n    |       |   |\n    |       |   \\---js\n    |       |           bootstrap.js\n    |       |           bootstrap.min.js\n    |       |\n    |       \\---jquery\n    |           \\---js\n    |                   jquery.min.js\n    |       \\---tablesorter\n    |           \\---addons\n    |           \\---beta-testing\n    |           \\---css\n    |           \\---docs\n    |           \\---js\n    |           \\---README.md\n    |           \\---testing\n    |                   changelog.txt\n    |                   component.json\n    |                   index.html\n    |                   package.json\n    |                   tablesorter.jquery.json\n    |                   test.html\n    |\n    +---routes\n    |       index.js\n    |\n    \\---views\n        |   index.jade\n        |   layout.jade\n        |\n        \\---mixins\n                form-helpers.jade\n\n## Application structure explained\n\n### app.js\nCreates and initializes an express app with a mongoDb connection configured. Routes will be setup by requiring the routes\ndirectory directly. See routes below.\n\n### helpers.js\nDefines some jade/html helpers for displaying error messages and displaying values. Reusable code\n\n### package.json\nInitial package with value entered in the prompt dialog\n\n### README.md\nEmpty readme to silence npm\n\n### config\nThe config directory is required by `app.js` to load the configuration files. Trestle assumes that you\n\thave four config files and two environment variables\n\t\tNODE_ENV - development or production\n\t\tPORT - any valid Port number\n\n* __defaults__ Defines defaults that are used in development and production mode -\n\t\t\tAddress, Port web page answers and the database name and location - Modify this if database if remote\n* __development__ Defines configuration values used in development mode only\n\t\t\tVerbose logging, default Port (3000) assignment, and Secret\n* __production__ Defines configuration values used in production mode only -\n\t\t\tNo logging, default Port (8000) assignment, and secret\n\t\t\tDo not pass the config.address to the Express Server startup\n* __index.js__ Checks environment variables\n\nTrestle loads defaults first, then loads the configuration file `development` or `production` depending on the\n\tcurrent `NODE_ENV` environment variable and overrides all default values with the \"development\" or \"production\"\n\tvalues.\n\n### lib\nTrestle ships with a single library file that is responsible to map values provided in request body to a mongoose\nmodel.\n\n### public\nThe public folder contains a quite up to date version of [twitter bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) under `vendor/boostrap`,\nan up to date version of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) under `vendor/jquery` and a `custom.css` file under css.\n\nTrestle organizes all shipped 3rd party css/javascript libraries are placed in the `vendor` directory and follows a `js`, `css`, `img` schema\nfor vendor libraries. You are free to place your libraries wherever you want :)\n\n### routes\nAll generated routes will be generated under routes. After creating an app with Trestle, you'll find a single\n\t`index.js` file in this folder. Index.js requires all files that are in or routes or a sub directory of routes\n\tto initialize the route. In case you require a route to be defined before another route you can always require\n\tthat route in `index.js` or load routes manually in a defined order.\n\nindex.js also defines a route to `/` to render a nice getting started page. This functionality can be removed\n\twithout harming the system!\n\n### views\nAll generated view will be generated under views. After creating an app with Trestle, you'll find an index.jade\n\tthat is a welcome file to display some help text or defined routes, a layout.jade file that defines the layout\n\t\tused by all generated views and a mixin folder that defines mixins used in Trestle generated views.\n\n## Trestle Change Log\n### 0.2.4\n* Fixed bugs in app.js.ejs\n\n### 0.2.3\n\n* Added column sorting using tablesorter\n* Added display message if using custom template\n* Changed Express server startup parameters depending on whether not in \"production\"\n* Converted original ADM icons that were on the end of each line into a clickible area in the first column\n\nTruss Change Log\n### 0.2.2\n\n* Fixed indentation to comply with Node.js style guides\n* Added a form helper for single select boxes\n\n### 0.2.1\n\n* Updated the edit and create templates to use the same form\n* Fixed issue with ObjectId not working in model creation\n\n### 0.2.0\n\n* Added Bootstrap 3 support\n* Errors on forms now use Bootstrap 3 class \"has-error\"\n* Mixin invocation uses the now standard \"+\" symbol instead of \"mixin\"\n\n## Bumm Change Log\n### 0.1.5\n\n* Add option to use mongodb session store\n* Support directories when scaffolding models, views and routes\n* Render a nice start page\n* Support rest resources for api services\n\n### 0.1.4\n\n* Express and Mongoose updates\n* Fix startup scripts\n* Provide better error messages\n* Use mixins to render forms\n\n### 0.1.3\n\n* Add `npm init` like prompt to specify generated package.json values by [thomas peklak](https://github.com/thomaspeklak)\n\n### 0.1.2\n\n* Minor bug fixes in views\n* Basic support for array types\n* Reorganizes public assets in vendor folder\n* Disable 'x-powered-by' header\n\n### 0.1.1\n\n* Bootstrap update\n* Mongoose update\n\n### 0.1.0\n\n* Initial version\n",
